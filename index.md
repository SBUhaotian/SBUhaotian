### <span style="color:royalBlue;font-weight:bold">Biography</span>

I am a research scientist and lead a research group at JD Logistics. I received my Ph.D. from Rutgers Univeristy, under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Gao](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jie-gao/about/). I obtained my B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **Algorithm Design**, **Spatial-Temporal Data Science** and **Networking Applications** such as wireless sensor networks, social netowrks, traffic networks and logistics networks.<br> You can contact me at wanghaotian18 AT jd DOT com. My publications can also be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=L88_fxoAAAAJ)

 * Design a homogeneous order grouping system to improve couriers’ workload measurement in last-mile delivery based on couriers’ reporting data, which has been deployed on a nationwide scale.
 * Propose a relay-based last-mile delivery scheme to improve delivery efficiency and design a relay route generation algorithm based on fined-grained courier mobility features, which has been deployed in more than 100 delivery stations.
 * Design a truck scheduling system for transporting orders from the transfer center to multiple delivery stations with the goal of minimizing the average order delivery time.
 * Design a workload-aware task assignment system in last-mile delivery to assign delivery tasks to couriers with the goal of achieving fairness among couriers from the energy consumption perspective.
 * Design a heterogeneous task assignment system in last-mile delivery to assign delivery tasks, customer expansion tasks, and real-time pick-up tasks to couriers to maximize the platform’s revenue.
