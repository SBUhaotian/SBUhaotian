### <span style="color:royalBlue;font-weight:bold">Biography</span>

I am a research scientist and lead a research group at JD Logistics. I received my Ph.D. from Rutgers Univeristy, under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Gao](https://sites.rutgers.edu/jie-gao/about/). I obtained my B.S. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **Algorithm Design**, **Spatial-Temporal Data Science** and **Networking Applications** such as wireless sensor networks, social netowrks, traffic networks and logistics networks.
